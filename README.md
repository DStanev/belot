# Project Base for Vaadin and Spring Boot

This is an example project that can be used as a starting point to create your own Vaadin application with Spring Boot.
It contains all the necessary configuration and some placeholder files to get you started.


## Running the Application
There are two ways to run the application :  using `mvn spring-boot:run` or by running the `Application` class directly from your IDE.

## The tomcat is started by default on localhost:8080
